## Short Search 

Simple chrome extension to define aliases to certain links. Just use the the extension popup to create aliases (or _cmd_s as they are in the extension) and use the keyword **ss** to trigger the extension in the search bar

> I just got overwhelmed with the number of bookmarks that I had and it came to a point where I felt navigating to the actual site would be simpler. Hence made this tool to help with my troubles

### Installation
This project is currently just a prototype so to use it you will have to load the extension directly from the source code.\
To do so, follow these steps

1. Clone the repository in the directory of your choice using: `git clone `
2. Open chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. You should see a toggle switch labelled **Developer Mode** on the top right of the screen. Make sure it is turned on
4. Click on **Load Unpacked** button on the top-right of the screen
5. Navigate to where you cloned the repo and open the `src` directory. _This should load the extension into the browser_
